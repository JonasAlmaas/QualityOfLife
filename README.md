# Blender Addon - Quality Of Life
Sometimes using Blender you might feel like it is missing a few things you wish were there. Therefore I decided to make this addon. I am planning on adding new features to it as time goes, so if you have some features you want to be added, feel free to send me a dm on [Discord](a "Almaas#0001").

Thanks for reading, and hopefully trying it out.

<!-- Features -->
## Snap to world axes
**Snap to world axes lets you select something and move it to one or more world axes, you can also snap to the active object axes.**

To use this feature make sure to be in either `OBJECT` or `EDIT` mode and press `This key-bind`. After that, select the axes you wish to snap to. If you want to snap to the object's axes instead, press `This key-bind` or who knows, do something else. This will only work after entering normal snap to world axes mode. Or who knows, maybe it will just work.
