# Blender Addon - Quality Of Life
Sometimes using Blender you might feel like it is missing a few things you wish were there. Therefore I decided to make this addon. I am planning on adding new features to it as time goes, so if you have some features you want to be added, feel free to send me a dm on [Discord](a "Almaas#0001").

<!-- Features -->
## Snap to world axes
**Snap to world axis** lets you select a vertex, edge, face, or object and move it to one or more world axes. There is also an additional option to snap to either object or 3D-cursor. Like any of the other features, you can access it through the right-click menu in either `OBJECT` or `EDIT` mode.

## Checker Select Edge Loop
**TODO**

There is a button for this in the menus, but it doesn't do anything yet.
